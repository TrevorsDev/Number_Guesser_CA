# Number Guesser Game

This project is Codecademy's "Challenge Project: Number Guesser" project. The goal of this project is to create a guessing game where the user plays against the computer. A random number ('target number') is generated within the JavaScript code, and compared against the computer's number guess and the users guess. The computers number is randomly generated ('computer guess') within the JavaScript code, and the user's number is manually entered into the input field on the users screen.

I've solved it via their website, but wanted to practice it again, and expand my learning. Ive done so by adding a layer of sophistication by applying to it the functionality of storing, and retrieving scores from the local storage within the browser. 

The script.js file contains the code that Ive written for this project. While the index.html and game.js files were code that I've downloaded from Codecademy.com. The downloaded code is everything that is needed in order for me to focus on the current level of learning that I am on in this program. AKA building the code within the script.js file.

I would also like to add the capability to reset the scores and rounds.
